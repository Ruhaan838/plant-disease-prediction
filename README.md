# Plant Disease Prediction

This repository contains code to train an image classifier for plant disease detection, export the model to ONNX, and serve predictions through a FastAPI backend with a simple web frontend.

Next steps:
- Confirm dataset and class list (e.g., PlantVillage)
- Train model in `src/train/`
- Export to ONNX and validate
- Serve using `src/api/app.py` and test the frontend in `src/web/`

See `requirements.txt` for Python dependencies.
